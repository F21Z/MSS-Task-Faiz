### About the Repo
In this repository, I'll be giving solutions to the Task Challenges
The programs encompass various tasks that express my understanding of data types, slicing, functions, control flow, and file handling.

The first task was to implement slicing on a list.<br/>
The second one required a firm grip on the concepts of functions, like function calls, optional parameters, and return values.<br/>
The Third task was to implement Control-Flow using if-else conditionals and looping statements.<br/>
The next task called for file handling knowledge, to capitalise the first letter (Camel Case) of each word from a given file and save it into a new file.<br/>
The fifth task was to implement the Dictionary data structure, to initialise, retrieve and print values.<br/>
The last task was based on the OOP concept i.e., Designing classes, creating instances and using class attributes and class methods.<br/>
